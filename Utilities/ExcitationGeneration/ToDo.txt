AVFTT - Excitation Generation

'MultiSineComponents' can only handle fully populated zippered type distributions, it should be expanded to haddle more distribution type. (hard)
Possible inconsistant "vectorized" signal use, signals should consistantly be passed as column vectors. (moderate)
Multiple signals should be passed as cell arrays, not 2-d arrays (this may be true of other combined vectors also). (moderate)
The optimization routine in 'MultiSineOptimalPhase' is slow, look to improve performance.
Add warning messages. (moderate)
Add seperate description documents. (hard)
Add test case data, etc. (hard)
