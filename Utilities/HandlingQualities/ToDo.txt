AVFTT - Handling Qualities

MIL 1797B exists, but isn't incorporated. Unknown discrepancies to existing routines. (very hard)
Incomplete definitions of the level boundaries for different categories, etc. (hard)
Only some level boundary routines return the level of the data point, all should. May require altering how the boundaries are defined to make them testable. (moderate)
Generalize the drawing of boundary levels. (moderate)
Evaluate SIDPAC v2, some routines exist for finding zeros and poles of frequency response data. It may be more general and useful, maybe not. Particularly compare with LOES techniques. (moderate)
