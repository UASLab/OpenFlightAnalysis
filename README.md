Open Flight Analysis (oFA)

oFA is a companion to OpenFlightSim (oFS) for simulation and RAPTRS for flight systems.

oFA is intended as a tool to analyze flight vehicle data. Both time-domain and frequency-domain based analysis are envisioned. Flight (and oFS) data are loaded and formated into an intermediate data structure known as oData (Open Data). A complete flight data record is segmented into individual segments and stored into an easily manipulated format. This allows for flight analysis that easily spans multiple flights and flight configurations. Flight/Simulation data logged from oFS and RAPTRS can be automatically loaded and segmented.

Specialty tools for conducting In-flight sensor calibration, Aerodynamic Parameter Identification (Aero-PID), and in-flight stability analysis (sometime refered to as Real-time Stability Margin analysis - RTSM) are to be incorporated.
